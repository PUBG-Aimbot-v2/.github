## **Aimbot vs Triggerbot in PUBG**

While a **triggerbot** fires automatically when your crosshair hits a target, an **aimbot** actively moves your crosshair to stay locked on enemies. This means in PUBG’s intense firefights—especially long-range battles—**aimbot ensures you never lose track** of your opponent, even if they zigzag or take cover.

Pro tip: Many players use aimbot with low aim assist settings so it looks more natural while still hitting every shot.
